# collaborative-central-patch

Collaborative central patch for students of Music 264.

## Set up
Click **[Clone in Desktop](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/mus264/collaborative-central-patch)**. Follow the on-screen instructions and choose a sensible place to save the repository.

A good idea would be to have a single folder on you computer to which you clone your personal repository, this repository, and any others you would like to use. Copy a `setpath.maxpat` into that repository, run it and restart Max. Now Max will see all the folders and be able to correctly load any abstractions and `[bpatchers]`.

**For this patch to work, you should clone [cs.2click](https://github.com/delucis/cs.2click) to use the input & output modules.**
